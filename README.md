### UFOs


### Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to provide an in depth analysis of UFO sightings. The JS webpage will allow users to filter different table data.

### Results
Once users enter the JS webpage, they are able to search specific information and output results to their liking. Being able to add multiple filters will give the user power for precision searching.

### Summary
One drawback to the table is you lose track of what the infomration is in each column once you scroll down; the headers dissapear. 
One reccomendation would be to have the table headers move down as well. Another reccomendation would be to get rid of case sensitivity on the table when searching through filters.
